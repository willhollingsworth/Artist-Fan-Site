    Sometimes music is about numbers sequences. When Modeselektor [Gernot Bronsert + Sebastian Szary] and Apparat [Sascha Ring] decide to become one, it is a trio band called Moderat who is brought into their tuneful world. Good things always come in threes and the result of this brilliant addition is unambiguous: hardly anybody has brought electronic music from Berlin to the farthest flung corners of the world with more passion and enthusiasm than these two heavyweights.

    In 2002, Sascha, Gernot and Sebastian met for the first time. At that point in time, Apparat and Modeselektor were well established in the Berlin music scene. Sascha had already released his debut album and Gernot and Sebastian, a series of 12''s. Collaborating together wasn't even debatable, the question was: When will they join forces? Walls of Berlin music studios have ears that know how privileged they were: they have witnessed during nearly 15 years the birth of several timeless gems.

    Moderat laid the foundation stone in 2003 with their very first release "Auf Kosten der Gesundheit" EP. The three friends saw at this exact period their careers in pairs and solo soar, and the release of their eponymous debut album in April 2009, did not bring them down. Perhaps the secret of Modeselektor's and Apparat's collaboration lies in the fact that they never even tried to get close to one another.  Modeselektor's thundering bass rumbles in the cellar, Apparat's sensitive and subtle melodies float high in the eaves. The fact that what one assumes to be incompatible actually communicates, is what makes Moderat so unique.
